Airline-Database-Analysis-using-SQL
Project Description :
In my Airline DB Capstone Project, I led the structuring and querying of crucial data on airline operations, passenger information, and flight schedules using SQL. I designed a robust database architecture to efficiently manage large datasets, ensuring data integrity and security. By developing optimized SQL queries, I extracted and analyzed critical information, enhancing operational efficiency and decision-making. Meticulous database management, including performance tuning and secure access controls, was essential to the project's success. This approach provided valuable insights, optimized flight schedules, and improved the overall passenger experience, laying a strong foundation for future data-driven strategies within the airline industry.
This project involves performing complex SQL queries on an Airline database to derive meaningful insights. The queries cover various aspects of airline operations, including booking information, passenger details, flight schedules, and aircraft information. The project showcases the use of advanced SQL techniques such as Joins, Subqueries, Common table expressions (CTEs), Window functions, and date formatting.


Database Structure :

The Airline database comprises multiple tables, including:

bookings - Information about bookings including booking reference, booking date, and total amount.

tickets - Details of tickets issued, including ticket number, passenger information, and booking reference.

boarding_passes - Information about boarding passes issued, including ticket number, boarding number, and seat number.

flights - Detailed flight information including flight number, departure and arrival airports, scheduled and actual departure and arrival times, and flight status.

aircrafts - Information about aircrafts including aircraft code and model.

airports - Information about airports including airport code and timezone.

seats - Details about seat availability and fare conditions on various aircraft.
